<span class="xdocspagetitle">Duplicate code detection</span> allows you to find
code that has been generated by Copy/Paste programming. Duplicate code typically
leads to higher maintainance cost because bugs will need to be fixed twice,
more code needs to be tested, etc.
</p>
<p>
There are many trade-offs when writing a duplicate code detection tool.
Some of the conflicting goals are:
<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Low memory usage</li>
<li>Avoid false alarms</li>
<li>Support multiple/arbitrary languages (Java, JSP, C++, ...)</li>
<li>Support Fuzzy matches (comments, whitespace, linebreaks, variable renaming, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The check provided here, StrictDuplicateCode, is fast enough to facilitate checking very large code
bases in acceptable time (minutes). It consumes very little memory, false
alarms are not impossible but a really rare case. While it supports multiple
languages it does not support fuzzy matches (that's why it's called Strict).
</p>
<p>
Note that there are brilliant commercial implementations of duplicate code
detection tools. One that is particularly noteworthy is
<a href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/">Simian</a>
from RedHill Consulting, Inc.
</p>
<p>
Simian has managed to find a very good balance of the above tradeoffs.
It is superior to the checks in this package in many repects.
Simian is reasonably priced (free for noncommercial projects)
and includes a Checkstyle plugin.
<strong>
We encourage all users of Checkstyle to evaluate Simian as an
alternative to the Checks we offer in our distribution.
